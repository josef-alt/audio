java audio
JavaFX's Media class provides basic audio functionallity; however, it leaves a lot to be desired. In my music-app project I found that I had to supplement JavaFX with an external library if I wanted to be able to read the metadata for some of the formats playable by JavaFX. I intend to rectify this.

To do: come up with better name than audio
